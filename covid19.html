			<h3>Face Coverings:</h3>
			
				<ul>
					<li>The <a href="https://www.mardenhigh.net/updated-guidance-face-coverings/">new rules</a> state that face coverings now only have to be worn in corridoors, where year bubbles can't be sperated.<br>This means that if students wish, they can take them off in their bubble zone (e.g- classrooms).</li>

					<li>Face coverings must be worn over the mouth and nose when they are on, and not worn covering the chin.</li>
				</ul>
			
			
			<h3>Cross contamination:</h3>
			
				<ul>
					<li>Students must bring their own stationary and equipment.</li>
					<li>Students are not allowed to share their equipment with other students to reduce cross-contamination.</li>

					<li>Students are not allowed to hug, high five, or shake hands.</li>
					<li>Students have set seating plans in their classes. This means that students must not move around in a class mid-way through a (half) term. This is to help with track and trace.</li>
				</ul>

					<li>Students must go home promptly, and not stay at the space in front of the gate.</li>
					<li>To increase air circulation, windows have to be open in classrooms. <br>This means that students have now been given the choice to wear a coat in the classroom if they are cold.</li>
				</ul>
			
			
			<h3>Detention Changes:</h3>
			
				<ul>
					<li>Detentions will be heald the day after a student had recieved the detention.</li>
					<li>Detentions will last for 15 minutes, from 3:15 to 3:30.</li>
