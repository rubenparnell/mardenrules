			<p>Unacceptable behavior can lead to consequences (as stated in <a href="http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/smartfile/ac964574086e5480e4c7c68968bc1ec0/uploads/2020/06/19094921/Student-Planner-final-draft.pdf">The Student Handbook</a>, page 7).</hp>

			<h3>Detentions:</h3>
				<p>
				Due to CoViD-19, Detentions have been changed.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Detentions will be heald the day after a student had recieved the detention.</li>
					<li>Detentions will last for 15 minutes, from 3:15 to 3:30.</li>
					<li>Detentions will be held with the student's head of year.</li>
					<li>These detentions can be for any reason, incuding behavior, lateness, and homework.</li>
					<li>The member of staff who teaches the student period 5 will walk them to their head of year for their detention.</li>
					<li>The time spent will be restorative, discussing 1:1 how best to avoid similar sanctions in future.</li>
					<li>A text message will go out to parents / carers on the day the detention is set so they are aware of the
					detention the following day.</li>
				</ul>
				<br><br>
				<p>Detentions can be given for many reasons, including:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Being repeatedly late to school or lessons, </li>
					<li>Not following the school's expectations,</li>
					<li>Not completing homework on time (the class teacher should give the student up to 24 hours to get the homework to them. If this is not completed, a detention will be issued).</li> 
					<li>Not wearing the correct school uniform,</li>
					<li>Repeatedly not having the correct equipment, if the teacher thinks this is neccecary,</li>
					<li>Being generally silly in lessons or at break/ lunch times,</li>
					<li>Breaking the science lab rules/ other rules set out by a teacher,</li>
