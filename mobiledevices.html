			<h3>Rules about Mobile Devices:</h3>
			<h4>
			As stated on page 10 of <a href="http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/smartfile/ac964574086e5480e4c7c68968bc1ec0/uploads/2020/06/19094921/Student-Planner-final-draft.pdf">The Student Handbook</a>:
			</h4>

			<ul>
			<li>Students can bring phones to school, but they should be switched off.</li>
			<li>Students using mobile devices between 8:45 and 3:15 will have them confiscated until the end of the day.</li>
			<li>If students need to contact their parents or guardians, they should go to reception.</li>
			<li>If parents or guardians need to contact a student, they should ring reception on 0191 296 2771.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h4>
			As stated in <a href="https://cdn.realsmart.co.uk/ac964574086e5480e4c7c68968bc1ec0/uploads/2020/09/23104444/Parents-and-Carers-FAQ-Online-Open-Evening-Sept-2020-1.pdf">the Year Seven Online Open Evening, Sept 2020</a>, question 'Can my child bring a phone into school?':
			</h4>
			
			<ul>
			<li>'Occationally, mobile devices may be used for a specific educational purpose, as directed by class teachers.'</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<h3>Online Saftey:</h3>
			<p>
			Students using social media should ensure that they are the correct age to be using the service.
			<br>
			Apps like Snapchat, Instagram, etc. have an age restriction of 13+. This means that students in year 7 should not use these apps.
			<br>
			<br>
			These apps pose a risk for students to be cyber-bullied, so it is vital that students know the risks of using these apps.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h4>People should not:</h4>
			<ul>
			<li>Be unkind or disrespectful to others (either directly to them or about them) - the same social rules apply online as in person.</li>
			<li>Create large group chats without the consent of those that you are inviting.</li>
			<li>Screenshot messages or social media content (videos, images) created by others to ridicule or be unkind about them.</li>
			<li>Connect with people you don’t know.</li>
			<li>Share other students’ details (phone number, social media profiles) with others.</li>
			<li>Be complicit or silent about negative social media interactions that you witness - by doing this you are allowing these negative behaviours to continue.</li>
			</ul>
